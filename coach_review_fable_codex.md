# ZidRun AI Coach — Combined Review (Fable × Codex)

*Date: 2026-08-02 · merges `coach_review_fable.md` (Claude Fable 5) and `coach_review_codex.md`
(Codex, rev `abee6f1`). This file is the **canonical merged assessment and roadmap**; the two
source files remain the deep-dive references (Fable: architecture map, prompt rewrites, memory/
context design, cost model, native-switch todo §9 · Codex: safety/consent analysis, test plan
§15, analytics/eval harness §14, open product questions §18).*

## 0. Cross-verification

The two reviews were produced independently. Before merging, every Codex P0/P1 headline claim
was re-verified against the code by the Fable reviewer, and Codex's coverage was checked against
Fable's findings:

| Codex claim | Verification |
|---|---|
| CR-001 chat text bypasses safety gate | ✅ **Confirmed** — `service.ts:1097-1104` passes selected/recent run + `goal.injuryNotes` into `evaluateCoachSafety`; `input.message` never enters it (`safety.ts:40-45` scans only run text) |
| CR-002 consent is unpersisted UI state | ✅ **Confirmed** — `coach-goal-form.tsx:86` `useState(isEdit)` (pre-checked on edit!), checkbox at `:461`; zero consent models/fields in `prisma/schema.prisma` |
| CR-004 dismissed memories can be re-learned | ✅ **Confirmed** — `memory-store.ts:58-63` supersedes only `ACTIVE` rows then inserts a new ACTIVE row unconditionally; the comment promising DISMISSED protection is not enforced; `deleteAllMemory` (`:186`) hard-deletes tombstones |
| CR-009 chat UI hides half the response schema | ✅ **Confirmed** — `coach-conversation.tsx:333-338` renders summary/progress/positive/warning only; `recoveryAdvice`/`usedSignals`/`dataGaps`/`followUpQuestion` are generated then discarded |
| CR-014 config/copy drift | ✅ **Confirmed** — admin page says "Free trial: 30 days"; `COACH_TRIAL_DAYS` defaults 7; `estimateCostMicroUsd` returns **0** for any non-`gpt-5.4-mini` model (`openai.ts:243`) |
| CR-003 planner ignores collected inputs | ✅ **Confirmed** — `targetTimeSeconds` never read; `targetDistanceKm` in `AdaptivePlannerInput` but unused (goal shape comes from `GOAL_PARAMS[goalType]`) |
| CR-006 goal edit leaves active plan untouched · CR-008 web draft-accept vs native auto-activate · CR-010 no idempotency key | ✅ All confirmed against `service.ts:267-305`, `saveDraftPlan` vs `ensureCurrentWeekPlan`, and both interaction routes |

**What each review uniquely contributed:** Codex found the safety/consent/idempotency/lifecycle
class of issues (governance & trust). Fable found the market/product class — Ramadan absence,
the darija prompt gap (darija is the *documented* Arabic register the AI was never told about),
the macro-plan invisibility, the prompt-structure problems, prompt-cache economics, and the
grounded cost model — plus the native-switch execution plan. One genuine disagreement is
recorded in §3. Both reviews independently reached the same core verdict:

> **The deterministic-planner-owns-the-numbers / model-only-explains split is right and must be
> kept.** The path forward is hardening state, safety, consent, and memory semantics — not a
> bigger model or an agent.

---

## 1. Combined executive summary

The coach is far beyond a chat wrapper: deterministic periodized planning with conservative,
tested load rules; post-generation safety enforcement that discards model workouts; structured
I/O; provenance-aware memory with runner controls; bounded context with hash/version tracing;
`store:false`; usage accounting; quotas; three locales; web + native clients. (Provider is
**OpenAI `gpt-5.4-mini`**, not Claude, contrary to the original brief.)

It is **not yet releasable as the flagship**, for two governance reasons (Codex) — and **not yet
sellable as the flagship**, for four product reasons (Fable):

**Release blockers (governance):**
1. Urgent symptoms typed into chat ("I fainted, chest pain") never reach the deterministic
   safety gate — the interaction is classified CLEAR and coached normally. (CR-001)
2. Health/body data is stored and sent to the provider with no auditable consent record —
   the checkbox is transient React state, pre-checked on edit. (CR-002; aligns with the
   EXECUTION_PLAN `SEC-002` blocker)

**Selling-point blockers (product):**
3. **No Ramadan/fasting awareness anywhere** — the most market-defining, mostly-deterministic
   feature available, absent (zero repo mentions). (Fable G2)
4. Onboarding is an 807-line form, not an interview; the coach's clarifying-question answers
   evaporate. (Fable G1 / Codex "progressive profiling")
5. The runner never sees more than one week — no roadmap to their race; `targetTimeSeconds` is
   collected and ignored. (Fable G4+G5 / Codex CR-003)
6. The AI's Arabic is MSA inside a product whose documented voice is Algerian darija. (Fable G11)

**Trust-erosion cluster (both):** "forget this" doesn't stick (CR-004), the UI hides the
rationale/recovery/follow-up fields that would make replies feel personal (CR-009), a goal edit
can leave a stale incompatible plan live (CR-006), web and native give different plan-commitment
semantics (CR-008), and duplicate taps can double-charge quota (CR-010).

**Cost:** not a constraint. ~$0.008/interaction on the mini model; ~$65/mo at a realistic
1,000-user mix; AI COGS ≈ 3–4% of subscription revenue. Spend more (auto weekly reviews ≈
$10/mo, extraction pass < $15/mo) rather than optimize — but fix the two accounting bugs
(unknown-model cost = $0; only static instructions ever cache-hit because the whole dynamic
context is one JSON blob).

## 2. Unified findings register

Severity: **P0** = blocker (release or selling-point) · **P1** = required for a credible
flagship · **P2** = important · **P3** = optimization. Source: F = Fable, C = Codex, F+C = found
independently by both. All C-items listed here were code-verified by F (§0).

| ID | Finding | Sev | Effort | Source |

| U-02 | No persisted, versioned health/AI-processing consent; checkbox pre-checked on edit | P0 | L | C (CR-002) |
| U-03 | Ramadan/fasting: no schema field, planner input, or prompt rule — deadline ≈ Feb 2027 | P0 | L | F (G2) |
| U-04 | Onboarding = giant form; no progressive interview; follow-up answers not captured | P0 | L | F (G1) + C (progressive profiling) |
| U-05 | Dismissed/deleted memory facts can silently return (no suppression tombstones; delete-all removes them) | P1 | M | C (CR-04) |
| U-06 | Planner ignores `targetTimeSeconds`, `targetDistanceKm`, recent result, sleep, constraints — no feasibility read, no goal-pace bands | P1 | L | F (G5) + C (CR-003, broader) |
| U-07 | No macro plan: only the current week exists; `weeksToRace` computed then discarded; runner can't see the road to race day | P1 | L | F (G4) |
| U-08 | Goal edits (new injury, removed day) leave the active plan untouched and actionable | P1 | M | C (CR-006) |
| U-09 | Web (AI draft → accept) vs native (instant deterministic activation) plan lifecycles diverge | P1 | M | C (CR-008) |
| U-10 | Interaction POST has no idempotency key; ~12s synchronous generation; retries double-charge | P1 | M | C (CR-010) |
| U-11 | Chat UI discards `recoveryAdvice`/`usedSignals`/`dataGaps`/`followUpQuestion` — rationale invisible, follow-up unanswerable | P1 | S | C (CR-009) |
| U-12 | AI Arabic register: darija is the documented product voice (`COACH_DESIGN_FLOW.md:249`) but the prompt never says so; arabizi unaddressed | P1 | S | F (G11) |
| U-13 | Proactive touchpoints are static cron copy only; no AI weekly review, post-run reaction, or pre-race brief | P1 | M | F (G6) + C (P3.1) |
| U-14 | Safety taxonomy is narrow (few cardio regexes); no heat-illness/medication/eating-disorder classes, no minors/age policy (planner also age-blind — COACHPAR-004) | P1 | L | C (CR-012) + parity review |
| U-15 | Injury/health memory blocked pending SEC-002 policy — coach forgets injuries after the 6-turn window | P1 | policy + S | F (G3) + C |
| U-16 | Memory extraction under-captures: ≤3 candidates piggybacked on the coaching reply at low reasoning effort; runner-stated facts land as `AI_INFERRED` with no confirmation loop | P1 | M | F (G7) + C (CR-005) — see §3 |
| U-17 | No native memory/privacy surface and no `/api/v1/coach/memory`; voice/TTS unwired natively; `coach:false` kill switch is dead code | P1 | L | F §9 + C (CR-007/016) + COACHPAR-001/002 |
| U-18 | Config/ops drift: stale `.env.example` quota names, admin "30-day trial" vs 7-day code default, unknown model priced $0, `/api/coach/tts` unmetered | P1 | S | F+C independently (F: env+tts, C: admin copy + $0 pricing) |
| U-19 | No product-quality events or offline eval harness (safety recall, planner invariants, response rubric) | P1 | L | C (CR-013) |
| U-20 | Prompt-cache structural miss: whole dynamic context is one JSON blob — only the ~1.4k-token instructions ever cache; char-based (not token-based) compaction | P2 | S | F (G9) + C (context budget) |
| U-21 | One 37-rule prompt for all 4 interaction types; mandatory-warmth rules contradict the anti-repetition rule; duplicated rules | P2 | S | F (G14 + §6) |
| U-22 | Completion classification is distance-only; sleep/readiness never alters deterministic load | P2 | L | C (CR-011) + F (2.4) |
| U-23 | Structured quality workouts missing (no reps/sets — "repeat short hard efforts" prose) | P2 | M | F (G10) |
| U-24 | Conversation continuity thin: 6-turn summarized window, no thread/session concept | P2 | M | F (G8) |
| U-25 | PBs/streaks computed for badges but absent from coach context/memory | P2 | S | F (G12) |
| U-26 | Audit gaps: `CoachInteraction.acceptedAt` unused; deterministic weekly plans labeled `AI_ASSISTED`; selected memory IDs not traced per interaction | P2 | M | C (CR-017) |

## 3. Where the reviews disagree

**Memory provenance (U-16 / Codex CR-005).** Codex calls storing runner-stated facts as
`AI_INFERRED` "misleading provenance." The code comment (`service.ts:1262-1264`) defends it as
deliberate conservatism: the *fact* came from the runner but the *extraction* is the model's
reading, so it is stored as an inference with confidence attached — the safer direction of
error. **Merged position:** the labeling is defensible, the missing piece is Codex's
confirmation loop — store candidates as `PROPOSED`, surface "Remember this?" with edit/confirm
(the memory panel already exists), and only confirmed facts become `RUNNER_STATED`-grade
context. That resolves the provenance question and raises extraction quality at once, and it
composes with Fable's async extraction pass (dedicated cheap-model call on long CHAT turns,
rolling thread summaries) rather than competing with it.

**Center of gravity.** Codex: "the plan is the product; chat explains it." Fable: the
conversational coach *is* the selling point, and the deterministic plan is its spine. These
converge in practice — both reject chat-as-freeform-oracle and both want the plan visible,
diffed, and explained — but they cut differently on investment order: Codex sequences
governance → lifecycle → intelligence; Fable sequences the market-facing differentiators
(Ramadan, interview, macro plan, darija) as soon as the P0s clear. The merged roadmap (§5) does
both: governance first because it is small-to-medium effort and legally load-bearing, product
differentiators immediately behind it because they are what 1,000 Algerians will pay 790 DA/mo
for.

**Release posture.** Codex scores 6.2/10 and recommends staying behind the current hold until
CR-001/002 + lifecycle fixes land. Fable agrees on the two P0s but notes the platform maturity
(deterministic engine, memory substrate, ops accounting) is above what the score implies — the
gap is concentrated, not diffuse. Merged verdict: **fix U-01/U-02 (small + policy work), ship
the trust cluster (U-05/08/09/10/11), and the coach is credible; ship U-03/04/06/07/12/13 and
it is a selling point.**

---

## 4. What both reviews agree works well (keep, don't re-architect)

1. Deterministic planner owns every number; `enforceCoachSafety` replaces model workouts —
   the single best decision in the codebase.
2. Conservative, tested load rules (observed-volume anchoring, ≤10%+3km clamp, return-from-break
   ~55%, pain/fatigue/missed-session reductions, no catch-up mileage) — 68/68 planner tests pass.
3. Structured strict-schema I/O that fails closed; bounded context with section-presence
   metadata, versioning, and sha256 trace; `store:false`; explicit PII exclusions.
4. Prompt-injection defenses and memory-source semantics (RUNNER_STATED > HUMAN_COACH >
   SYSTEM_DERIVED > AI_INFERRED; REJECTED_SUGGESTION never repeated).
5. Server-side authority everywhere: ownership-scoped SQL, tiered quotas counting even failed
   calls, per-route rate limits, pre-model gates (topicality regex, safety block) that cost $0.
6. Run-reality capture: matching tiers (AUTO ≤15% / SUGGEST ≤40%), completion types, skip
   reasons, non-foot-activity exclusion, Algiers-calendar missed-session closing.
7. Runner-facing memory controls (view/confirm/dismiss/export/delete) — ahead of most shipped
   AI products, once U-05 makes "forget" durable.
8. Cost discipline: mini model, low reasoning effort, output caps, usage accounting with
   admin ops report; deterministic weekly rollover costs nothing.

---

## 5. Merged roadmap

*Supersedes Codex §16 and Fable §7/§9 as the single sequence. Native-first: the mobile client is
switching from Capacitor to `native-android/` (owner decision 2026-08-02), so client work lands
on native + additive `/api/v1`; Capacitor stays the rollback path (`NATIVE-007`).*

> **Owner decisions (2026-08-02):** trial is **7 days** (admin copy was wrong, not the code) ·
> plan lifecycle is **instant deterministic activation + easy adjust** on both clients
> (acceptance reserved for material-change diffs) · consent is **scaffolded now** ahead of the
> SEC-002 policy text · work starts with **Tier 0 in full**.

### Tier 0 — governance blockers — ✅ implemented 2026-08-02

- [x] **U-01 Safety preflight on current input** — `containsUrgentSymptomText()` +
      `urgentSymptomDecision()` in `safety.ts`; scanned **before topicality and entitlement** in
      `createCoachInteraction` (a red-flag message previously could even be refused as
      *off-topic*, since "chest pain"/"faint" aren't in the topicality vocabulary); the live
      message is also appended to the CAUTION-level scan; BLOCKED row persisted (quota-free) as
      the audit record. Patterns cover EN/FR/Arabic script + curated arabizi/darija, incl. heat
      stroke. Golden set (18 urgent, 9 benign incl. collision controls) in
      `scripts/test-coach.ts` — passing. *Remaining: owner-reviewed escalation copy + broader
      taxonomy (§7 Q3), sleep-note scanning.*
- [x] **U-02 Auditable consent (scaffold)** — `CoachConsent` model + enums + migration
      `20260802120000_coach_consent_and_unpriced_cost`; `src/lib/coach/consent.ts`
      (`COACH_CONSENT_POLICY_VERSION = "coach-consent-2026-08-v1"`, idempotent grant per policy
      version, withdrawal helper); grants persisted from goal create *and* edit with
      `sourceClient` web/native; `consent` added (optional/additive) to `createCoachGoalSchema`;
      form checkbox **never pre-checked** and required on create and edit, and now actually sent
      in the payload (it previously wasn't transmitted at all). *Remaining: SEC-002 policy text,
      enforcement, withdrawal UI.*
- [x] **U-05 Memory suppression** — `validateMemoryCandidates` takes a `dismissedSlots` set
      (rejects any candidate whose `(kind,key)` the runner dismissed, all sources);
      `writeMemories` fetches DISMISSED tombstones per user; 6 new pure tests (42/42 passing).
      *Deliberately kept: `deleteAllMemory` stays a full erase pending §7 Q9 (suppression
      shells vs right-to-erase).*
- [x] **U-18 Config truth** — `.env.example` + `CODEX_CONTEXT.md` now name the real quota vars;
      admin "Pricing & limits" derives from `COACH_TRIAL_DAYS`/`COACH_TIER_LIMITS` (was
      hardcoded "30 days"); `estimateCostMicroUsd` returns **null** for unknown models,
      `AiUsageLog.estimatedCostMicroUsd` made nullable (same migration), ops report gains
      `ai.unpricedRequests`; `/api/coach/tts` now entitlement-gated (TRIAL+SUBSCRIBED allowed,
      NONE → 402).

### Tier 1 — trust cluster + native rails (parallel tracks)

*Server track:*
- [ ] **U-10 Idempotent interactions** — client `requestId`, unique `(userId, requestId)`,
      return existing interaction on retry; status endpoint (full async lifecycle can follow —
      U-27).
- [ ] **U-08 + U-09 One plan lifecycle** — deterministic preview → explicit acceptance →
      active, identical on web and native; material goal edits mark the plan stale / safety-
      pause incompatible sessions with a visible diff; persist `acceptedAt`; label RULE_BASED
      weeks accurately (U-26).
- [ ] **U-11 Render the hidden fields** — "Based on" chips (`usedSignals`), "Missing"
      (`dataGaps`), recovery actions, one-tap `followUpQuestion` reply — schema + translations
      already exist; smallest highest-leverage UX change in the codebase.
- [ ] **U-12 + U-21 Prompt bump `coach-v11`** — darija register rule; per-interaction-type
      variants; de-templated POST_RUN warmth; goal-time feasibility rule (interim until U-06);
      dedupe rules. (Full rewrites: Fable §6.)
- [ ] **U-20 Cache-stable context** — [static instructions][semi-stable dossier][volatile]
      layout, stable key order, token-based budget; ~25% AI cost off and prerequisite for any
      model experiment.
- [ ] **U-25 PERFORMANCE memory + records in context** (small migration + write on PB).

*Native track (from Fable §9 P0, unchanged):*
- [ ] `/api/v1/coach/memory` + native memory/privacy screen (COACHPAR-002; carries U-05's new
      suppression semantics and U-02's consent surface).
- [ ] Voice input + TTS in native composer (COACHPAR-001) — after U-10 so voice sends are
      idempotent (Codex P3.4 dependency, adopted).
- [ ] Real kill switch: honour `/api/v1/config` flags, then flip `coach: true` (RUNPAR-006).
- [ ] Manual entry + GPX import or hide the dead controls (NATPAR-003).
- [ ] Verify coach push delivery on native (rail for U-13); web-handoff token for subscribe
      (NATPAR-002).
- [ ] Production v1 endpoint probes as a release gate (Codex CR-007 — `404/405` drift).

### Tier 2 — the selling point (product differentiators, native-first UI)

- [ ] **U-03 Ramadan mode** — `observesRamadan` + `fastingTrainingPref` on `RunnerGoal`, Hijri
      util, deterministic timing/intensity rules, prompt block, one intake question.
      **Calendar-locked: well before ≈ Feb 2027.**
- [ ] **U-04 Progressive interview** — 6-field minimal form → `CoachThread(purpose: INTERVIEW)`
      + `CoachIntakeState.pendingSlots`, ≤2 asks/reply, answers land in structured columns or
      as `PROPOSED` memory (per §3's merged confirmation loop). Build the conversational UI in
      native `CoachOnboardingScreen`.
- [ ] **U-06 + U-07 Feasibility + macro plan** — validated-effort fitness estimate with
      confidence ("finish safely / stretch / build consistency" modes, never certainty);
      `TrainingBlock` table (goalId, weekIndex, phase, plannedKm, note) generated at goal
      creation, weekly plans linked to their block; native roadmap screen ("week 6 of 14 —
      build"); goal-pace bands only with a valid performance anchor (Codex invariant).
- [ ] **U-13 Proactive AI** — auto WEEKLY_REVIEW Sunday evening over the verified push rail
      (~$10/mo at target scale); one-line post-run reaction on plan-completing runs; pre-race
      brief when a linked `RaceEvent` is ≤7 days out. Respect quiet hours (U-28).
- [ ] **U-16 + U-24 Extraction pass + threads** — cheap-model extraction on long CHAT turns
      writing `PROPOSED` facts + rolling `CoachThread.summary` replacing the 6-turn window.
- [ ] **U-15 Injury memory** — flip INJURY_STATUS/RECOVERY_STATUS into the writable set behind
      the U-02 consent flag with default expiry; surface consent in the native memory screen.

### Tier 3 — depth (after measurement exists)

- [ ] **U-19 Eval harness first** — content-free events (Codex §14 table), provider stub,
      safety golden set, planner cohorts/invariants, response rubric; CI-blocking.
- [ ] **U-22 Readiness policy** — sleep trend + pain/fatigue + workload → deterministic
      load/intensity modifier with an explicit insufficient-data state; planned-vs-actual using
      duration/pace/RPE, not distance alone.
- [ ] **U-14 Safety taxonomy v2 + age policy** — broadened multilingual classes, minors
      decision, age-aware planner bands (COACHPAR-004 owner decision, pinned by
      `test-adaptive-planner.ts`).
- [ ] **U-23 Structured workouts** — `structure` JSONB on `TrainingWorkout` (reps/distance/
      pace/recovery), rendered natively, fed to guided audio; extend `workout-i18n`.
- [ ] **U-27 Async lifecycle + deterministic fallback**; **U-29 constraint-aware scheduling**;
      Codex P3.2 human-coach collaboration (authority rules: never above safety); P3.3 wearable
      imports (only after consent lifecycle + eval exist).

### Explicitly postponed (both reviews agree)

Autonomous model tool execution or direct plan mutation · medical diagnosis/prescription ·
embedding/vector retrieval before structured memory demonstrably misses facts · readiness-score
leaderboards · fully autonomous multi-week plan changes without runner review · any model
upgrade before U-19/U-20 make its effect measurable.

---

## 6. Combined quick wins (shippable this week, ordered by leverage)

1. **U-01 minimal form**: pass `input.message` into the existing `evaluateCoachSafety` text
   scan + add EN/FR/AR chat-only red-flag tests. (One-line data-flow change buys the P0's worst
   case while the full taxonomy is reviewed.)
2. **U-11**: render the four hidden response fields in `coach-conversation.tsx`.
3. **U-05 minimal form**: check for a DISMISSED row on `(userId, kind, key)` in
   `validateMemoryCandidates`/`writeMemories` before insert.
4. **U-18**: env names, admin trial copy, "unpriced" cost label, TTS entitlement gate.
5. **U-12**: the darija prompt rule (+ goal-time feasibility rule) — bump `COACH_PROMPT_VERSION`.
6. **U-10 minimal form**: accept a client `requestId`, unique-constraint it, return the existing
   row on conflict.
7. **U-08 minimal form**: on material goal edit, set the active plan's status to a
   needs-review state and surface a banner.
8. **U-25**: PERFORMANCE memory kind + PB write + records block in context.
9. **U-26**: persist `acceptedAt` on plan activation; label rule-based weeks `RULE_BASED` in
   the UI.
10. **CR-007 slice**: add production v1 coach-endpoint smoke probes to the release checklist.

---

## 7. Open decisions for the owner (merged)

1. Health-data legal basis, retention, provider-processing notice, and consent copy (gates
   U-02 → U-15). *(Codex Q1)*
2. Minors policy for the coach. *(Codex Q2)*
3. Reviewed Algeria-appropriate escalation wording (EN/FR/darija) for urgent-symptom blocks.
   *(Codex Q3)*
4. Intended trial length (7 vs 30 days) and final tier limits. *(Codex Q4)*
5. One plan-acceptance semantic for both clients — explicit accept everywhere, or documented
   native auto-activation? *(Codex Q5)*
6. Human-coach authority model (`humanCoaching` subscriptions exist; notes are advisory today).
   *(Codex Q6)*
7. **Ramadan mode scope for the 2027 cycle** — full planner integration vs prompt+timing-only
   v1. *(Fable)*
8. **Model strategy** — stay on `gpt-5.4-mini`, or A/B a stronger model for Arabic/darija reply
   quality once U-19 (eval) and U-20 (cache) land; the deterministic planner stays model-free
   either way. *(Fable; Claude mapping: Haiku 4.5 ≈ like-for-like ~$0.010/interaction, Sonnet 5
   ≈ ~$0.032 — both affordable at 1k users.)*
9. "Delete everything" promise vs suppression shells and audit records. *(Codex Q8)*
